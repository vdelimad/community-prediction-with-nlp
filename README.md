### Abstract

In the study, we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine whether we can accurately classify Reddit posts into their respective subreddit by analyzing the language contained in the post's text. We conducted the research by employing Term Frequency methods and supervised learning algorithms. Our findings show that the language individuals use when participating in discussions within a community context provides sufficient information for models to make excellent predictions. We also offer an overview of the details related to model construction and explore the implications of the results.
